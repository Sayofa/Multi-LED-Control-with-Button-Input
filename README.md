This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking program using an ATmega32 microcontroller. The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with embedded C programming and understand the basics of microcontroller I/O operations. By programming the ATmega32 to control the LED with a button, I learned fundamental skills in setting up input/output pins and using pull-up resistors effectively. This is the first step in my embedded systems learning journey, with more complex projects planned ahead.
